          <p>Hi guys, so in my first post I will be sharing my top 5 favorite singers/bands.</p>
           <p>1. Taylor Swift, is my favorite singer of all time because, her music is so good. I am not a fan of country music but, her music when she was country was really good. And her album, "1989" which features the hit songs; Shake It off, Blank Space, and Bad Blood all reached number one on the billboard charts. Style got to number six, Wildes dreams number five, and Out of the Woods number eighteen. Anyway "19889 has to be one of he best pop albums of all time. So my point is, she is so amazing and I recommend her music.</p>
          </p>
          <p>2. My second favorite artist is (drumroll)...Ariana Grande! I love her album My Everything, Which includes the hit songs; Problem, Break Free, Love Me Harder, and my personal favorite Why Try. The album was also nominated for "Best Pop Vocal Album". Also her new album, "Dangerous Woman" which includes the hit songs; Focus, Dangerous Woman, and Into You(my favorite).
          </p>
          <p> 3. The number three spot goes to...One Direction! A lot of people don't like them but, guess what, I do! I love their album "Made in the A.M" I also love their older albums, and singles. It broke m heart when Zayn left but, they seemed to come back strong after. I recommend their music.</p>
          <p> 4. Adele. Her voice is like a bunch of tiny angels singing their way down from heaven. Her newest album "25" has the it songs; Hello, When we Were Young, and Send My Love(to your new lover). My favorite album of hers is "21". Did you know she's not naming her next album after her age? Anyway if you trust me go and buy her music...Right Now!</p>
          <p> 5. Rihanna. Rihanna has so many hit songs, it's hard not to love her. Her voice...I love it! My favs from her are; This is what you came for, Work, What's my name, Diamonds, and Stay. Also she has her ow unique style and her own sunglasses line. Cool, right?</p>
          <p> So thanks for reading my first post. If you liked it stay tuned for more posts! Bye!</p>
